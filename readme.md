# Vanilla Baby!

The Vanilla MVC application is an example that showcases some major concepts of  
the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It provides a starting point for understanding  
how to structure and organize code in a vanilla JavaScript Single Page Application.   
The application includes features such as routing, component rendering, and build automation.
